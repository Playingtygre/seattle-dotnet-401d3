# Data Structure implementaions

For each of the implementations within this folder, you will be creating a new folder in your Data Structures and Algorithms Repo named `Data Structures`. 

Following the same pattern as the `Challenges` folder, your default readme for the `Data Structures` folder should hold a table of contents of all the different implemnetations you have. 
Each individual folder inside this directory will be the individual implementations of different data structures.
the readme document for each of the implementations is a comprehensive readme of what this data structure is and how to use it. Create your own technical documenation!
