# Linked Lists

Reflecting back on the linked list lecture in class, implement a linked list within Visual Studio. 
Implement a singly linked list with the following methods:

1. O(1) - .Add() - adds a node to the front of the linked list
2. O(n) - .Find() - Finds a specific value in the linked list

Your final project should have
1. Node class, 
2. LinkedList class
3. Program Class.
