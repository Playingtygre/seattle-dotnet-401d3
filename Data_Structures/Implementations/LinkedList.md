# Linked Lists

Reflecting back on the linked list lecture in class, implement a Singly linked list within Visual Studio. 
Implement a `singlyLinkedList` with the following methods:

1. O(1) - .Add() - adds a node to the front of the linked list
2. O(n) - .Find() - Finds a specific value in the linked list

Your final project should have
1. Node class, 
2. LinkedList class
3. Program Class.

Be sure to test your Singly Linked List using Unit Tests as well to prove that the requirements above are met.
