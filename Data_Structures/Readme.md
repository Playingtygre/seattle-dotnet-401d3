# Data Structures

## Structure

The `Data_Structures_And_Algorithms` folder structure should mimic what your Data_Structures_And_Algorithms repository should look like.

The structure should be as follows (please note that your `Data Structures and Algorithms` will be a repo, and not a folder):

```markdown

>> Data Structures and Algorithms (Repository Name)
>> >> assets (holds all of your whiteboard images)
>> >> Challenges (Holds all individual code challenges)
>> >> >> FizzBuzz (Name of Challenge Folder)
>> >> >> >> FizzBuzz Solution folder
>> >> >> >> >> Program.cs
>> >> >> >> FizzBuzz Unit Tests
>> >> >> >> >> TestCode.cs
>> >> >> >> FizzBuzz.sln
>> >> >> >> Readme.md (Challenge Overview)
>> >> Data Structures (Holds all implementations of standard data structures)
>> >> Readme.md (List all Challenges completed)

```
